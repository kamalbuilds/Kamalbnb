## About the frontend
The frontend is build using NextJS which builds on top of ReactJS.
It contains components such as Dashboardmap , map , Navbar , review.
All of which when joined together gives the app an attractive and useful look. 
Under pages there is a dynamic route called [slug].js which corresponds to the backend where it is generated.

Bassically a _slug_ is a human-readable, unique identifier, used to identify a resource instead of a less human-readable identifier like an id .For example,  **“product-name” is the slug in www.ecommerce.com/category/product-name/**

## How to Run 
Although the website is already deployed [here](https://kamalbnb.vercel.app/)

Inorder to  run in the development server:

```bash
clone the repo
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
